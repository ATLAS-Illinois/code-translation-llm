Pending Removal in Python 3.16
******************************

* "builtins":

  * Bitwise inversion on boolean types, "~True" or "~False" has been
    deprecated since Python 3.12, as it produces surprising and
    unintuitive results ("-2" and "-1"). Use "not x" instead for the
    logical negation of a Boolean. In the rare case that you need the
    bitwise inversion of the underlying integer, convert to "int"
    explicitly ("~int(x)").

* "array":

  * The "'u'" format code ("wchar_t") has been deprecated in
    documentation since Python 3.3 and at runtime since Python 3.13.
    Use the "'w'" format code ("Py_UCS4") for Unicode characters
    instead.

* "shutil":

  * The "ExecError" exception has been deprecated since Python 3.14.
    It has not been used by any function in "shutil" since Python 3.4,
    and is now an alias of "RuntimeError".

* "symtable":

  * The "Class.get_methods" method has been deprecated since Python
    3.14.

* "sys":

  * The "_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()" function has been
    deprecated since Python 3.13. Use the
    "PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING" environment variable instead.

* "tarfile":

  * The undocumented and unused "TarFile.tarfile" attribute has been
    deprecated since Python 3.13.
